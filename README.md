# Comonotonic factor models

This project is to develop comonotonic factor models that can be used to model various multivariate dependence structures, and the license is GPL-3.

Some data examples can be tried:

"CM_bifact_example.r", an example with body component data fitted with comonotonic bi-factor model based on Positive Stable (PS) and Mittag-Leffler (ML) Laplace transforms.
Model-based pairwise Spearman's rho can be calculated.
