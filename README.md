# ComonoFactor - a developing R package for Comonotonic Factor Models

This project is to develop comonotonic factor models that can be used to model various multivariate dependence structures, and the license is GPL-3. The current form is only used for developing the paper [Hua and Joe (2017)](http://niu.edu/leihua/papers/comfac_hua_joe_uploaded.pdf). A more useful R package is to be developed.
