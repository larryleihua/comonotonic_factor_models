# ComonoFactor - a developing R package for Comonotonic Factor Models

This project is to develop comonotonic factor models that can be used to model various multivariate dependence structures, and the license is GPL-3. The current form is only used for developing the paper [Hua and Joe (2017)](http://niu.edu/leihua/papers/comfac_hua_joe_uploaded.pdf). A more useful R package is to be developed.

# Comonotonic factor models

This project is to develop comonotonic factor models that can be used to model various multivariate dependence structures, and the license is GPL-3.

Some data examples can be tried:

"CM_bifact_example.r", an example with body component data fitted with comonotonic bi-factor model based on Positive Stable (PS) and Mittag-Leffler (ML) Laplace transforms.
Model-based pairwise Spearman's rho can be calculated.
